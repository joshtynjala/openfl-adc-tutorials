Over the course of this tutorial, you'll get an overview of what Stage3D is and how it works. You'll also get to create some simple Stage3D geometry with Vertex Buffers and Index Buffers using Haxe.</p><h3 id="understanding-stage3d" tabindex="-1">Understanding Stage3D</h3><p>Stage3D is an OpenFL API that is dedicated to real-time 3D rendering. With Stage3D, developers can take full advantage of the capabilities of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which is a specialized secondary processor and part of the video hardware of most phones, tablets, and desktop computers. While OpenFL's vector and bitmap graphics are automatically GPU accelerated by default, Stage3D gives developers deeper control over 3D rendering, with lower-level APIs that allow for major performance optimizations for specialized 3D content.</p><p>If you think back to the time when 3D hardware acceleration initially came out for native platforms, you'll remember how it changed the world of 3D coding forever. The quality and complexity of games increased exponentially. Hardware acceleration has vastly improved the capabilities of 3D games, by enabling the lightning-fast rendering required for complex models, realistic effects, and responsive game play.</p><p>With its ability to compile to JavaScript for web browsers, or to C++ for native apps on both mobile and desktop, OpenFL can reach just about any platform. Games and applications developed in OpenFL become instantly available for use on virtually any major device in the world. Users can enter the game's URL in a browser and begin playing it immediately. Besides their browser, the user doesn't need to install anything: special runtime libraries, OS versions, or special hardware are not required.</p><p>That's what Stage3D is all about. It's about leveraging the 3D hardware that is present in any modern computer in order to build 3D games and 3D interactive websites that can easily be experienced using every single computer connected to the Internet.</p><h3 id="working-with-3d-hardware-acceleration" tabindex="-1">Working with 3D hardware acceleration</h3><p>In this section, you'll get an overview of rendering OpenFL content with 3D hardware acceleration.</p><p>3D hardware acceleration leverages a very advanced piece of hardware, the GPU, which is included in all modern devices. GPU is totally dedicated to the task of rendering content in 3D.</p><p>Using this setup, the software, your OpenFL application, will limit itself to just specifying the definition of a 3D scene. It passes the 3D scene data to the GPU hardware so that the hardware can process the data and render the scene. This process is much faster than using the CPU to render 3D content with software mode rendering.</p><p>Take a moment to compare the differences between software mode rendering and hardware mode rendering.</p><p>Generally speaking, a 3D scene is defined as a group of 3D geometries (meshes). Each geometry is specified as a set of triangles, and each triangle, in turn, is comprised of a set of vertices. So, defining a 3D scene simply means to define a set of vertices, and eventually add some related rendering information — such as textures or vertex colors.</p><p>If you were to render this stream of vertices without Stage3D, a software-based renderer would need to calculate the screen positions of the triangles, and then it would prompt OpenFL's <code>Graphics</code> class to natively render those triangles one by one, through a series of &quot;fill&quot; draw operations.</p><p>This process, although it could be smartly coded within the engine, is extremely slow. In some cases, the rendering result wouldn't be particularly accurate. The content would be rendered per triangle, instead of per pixel. This causes depth sorting errors. Triangles would sometimes render out of place, at the wrong depth.</p><p>In order to compare statistics, a software-based renderer using HTML canvas or native Cairo in OpenFL might render scenes with a maximum of 4,000 triangles only to maintain acceptable performance.</p><p>Now consider the possibilities with Stage3D. Using 3D hardware acceleration, the software simply defines the geometries and then passes them on to the computer's GPU. The geometries are uploaded to the GPU memory, which is a piece of memory that sits on the video hardware that is dedicated for use by the GPU. The GPU receives the data and processes it, completely taking over the job of rendering the 3D content.</p><p>The software works much more efficiently because it is only required to pass the parameters needed for rendering to the GPU. For example, the software specifies where the eye point (the 3D camera) is located in the 3D scene, sets the location of lights in the scene, and other details about the 3D objects and effects in the scene.</p><p>The GPU receives all this data. It starts by analyzing the defined vertices and begins rendering the scene triangle by triangle. The GPU produces the final rendered image that is ready for display on the screen.</p><p>The GPU rendering process is much faster than software mode. The GPU is designed to focus on a very specific task: it simply calculates the vertices and renders triangles. That's it.</p><p>Since the hardware of the GPU is extremely specialized for this very specific task, the hardware accelerated 3D rendering process is extremely efficient.</p><p>In contrast, the CPU is a generic processor. It not optimized for the specific task of rendering triangles. As a result, it is much less efficient at the rendering operation, as you might experience if you try rendering OpenFL 3D content with OpenFL's HTML Canvas renderer or the native Cairo renderer.</p><p>To compare the numbers, using hardware acceleration it's not uncommon to render scenes that contain more than a million triangles. A significant improvement over the 4,000 triangles rendered in software mode.</p><h3 id="analyzing-the-3d-rendering-pipeline" tabindex="-1">Analyzing the 3D rendering pipeline</h3><p>Hardware-based 3D rendering is facilitated by a 3D rendering pipeline. The word pipeline means that the rendering process is divided into a set of elementary operations. The GPU consists of a series of blocks; each block is dedicated to one of these elementary operations. The blocks are setup as a cascade so that each block's output feeds the input of the following block.</p><p>The earliest type of 3D graphics rendering pipeline that was released was called a fixed function pipeline. The word fixed refers to the fact that it was not a programmable pipeline in any way. Fixed function pipelines are somewhat rigid, because they simply receive geometry data as input, process the data through the pipeline blocks, and produce the final output rendered image (see Figure 1).</p><p><img src="/openfl-adc-tutorials/articles/how-stage3d-works/fig01-v2.jpg" alt="Figure 1. The blocks of a fixed function graphics pipeline."></p><p><em>Figure 1. The blocks of a fixed function graphics pipeline.</em></p><p>To work with a fixed function pipeline, you feed the GPU the following input: geometry description (vertices and triangles), textures to apply to the geometries, the position and orientation of the geometries in the 3D scene, the position and orientation of the eye point (3D camera), lights (how many, what color, and what position), and additional parameters needed to specify how the rendering will take place.</p><p>In other words, using the older system, you pass the hardware a set of vertex / triangle / texture data along with a set of parameters and the 3D hardware renders it.</p><p>The fixed function pipeline includes a transform and lighting block that transforms the vertices from local (model) space and projects them to the screen. It also applies per-vertex lighting. This block is followed by a viewport clipping block responsible for clipping the projected content to the content that is actually visible, which adapts it to the format of the viewport on the screen.</p><p>The projected and clipped data is then passed down the pipeline to the rasterizer stage, which performs the texture mapping. It also eventually applies fogging, alpha blending effects, and performs the depth buffering test necessary for rendering triangle pixels with the proper depth sorted order.</p><p>Now, the fixed function pipeline has worked well for many years, but over time it became apparent that this process of rendering was a bit rigid. Especially regarding lighting, the rendering was limited to using the standard shading models, such as the basic Goraud and Phong. The fixed function pipeline isn't flexible enough for developers to add creatively fun and interesting effects. In many cases, the renderings looked the same.</p><p>Then, the programmable graphics pipeline was introduced. A block diagram of the programmable graphics pipeline illustrates the new process for rendering (see Figure 2):</p><p><img src="/openfl-adc-tutorials/articles/how-stage3d-works/fig02.jpg" alt="Figure 2. The blocks of the programmable graphics pipeline."></p><p><em>Figure 2. The blocks of the programmable graphics pipeline.</em></p><p>The big difference in the new system is the introduction of the two blocks called Vertex Shader and Fragment Shader. These two blocks are actually programmable. When you write an application using the programmable pipeline you get to write code snippets, called <em>shaders</em>, which affect what happens within the rendering pipeline.</p><p>With the advent of this seemingly small change in the pipeline, the introduction of shaders, everything changed in the world of 3D rendering.</p><p>By writing little programs that affect how vertices are transformed and modified (Vertex Shaders) and how triangle pixel colors are rendered (Fragment Shaders) it is now possible to create amazing effects that could not be rendered before. For example, using shaders you can apply all kinds of lighting techniques, which can now be custom programmed for a specific application, instead of using the default lighting provided by the pipeline. Shaders make it possible to add shadows, hardware accelerated bones systems, and many other cool effects.</p><p>Later in this tutorial series, you'll learn how to work with shaders and the programmable rendering pipeline. But for now, it's just important to know that Stage3D is completely based on the programmable function pipeline. You don't even have the option of using the fixed function pipeline. This is a benefit, because you get to take advantage of the full power of the graphics hardware by leveraging the programmability of shaders. You can now create amazing effects in OpenFL 3D projects.</p><p>With power also comes responsibility. In order to run even the simplest rendering, you are required to write your own shaders. Using the programmable rendering pipeline, you cannot simply just set a few parameters and render a project as before using the fixed function pipeline.</p><h3 id="comparing-the-advantages-and-restrictions-of-working-with-stage3d" tabindex="-1">Comparing the advantages and restrictions of working with Stage3D</h3><p>In this section you'll learn the advantages of working with Stage3D compared to the standard native platform 3D APIs: OpenGL and DirectX. OpenGL and DirectX have been available for many years. They are a mainstream approach used to create great games in modern computers.</p><p>To start, creating a 3D application using DirectX and OpenGL is not an easy task. It's pretty straightforward to render a simple triangle, but creating a full-blown 3D application in C++ requires quite a bit of skill. It's certainly not a task for the inexperienced programmer.</p><p>One of the difficulties in creating a native 3D application has to do with using the standard DirectX and OpenGL APIs. In order to provide developers with the full power of the graphics hardware, the project must provide a full set of hardware-specific options. The native APIs are really close to the hardware. Development includes dealing with the hardware capabilities of the specific GPU available when the application is running. And it is often necessary to tune code, so that it can take full advantage of the most powerful hardware. This is a benefit for developers, because you get to create the most amazing effects on the most advanced hardware. But it also means that the application must be tuned and tested for several different pieces of hardware.</p><p>This is not the case when working in Stage3D. You simply code against the Stage3D abstractions, such as Context3D and Program3D. And the applications you create will run on every platform that OpenFL supports.</p><p>In a way, Stage3D is a bit more abstract than native APIs and a bit more distant from the hardware itself. As a result, Stage3D is much easier to use.</p><p>This, of course, also has some disadvantages because you don't really target specific hardware in order to take advantage of the specific power available in each platform. You just code generically for the virtual Stage3D platform; Stage3D acts as a layer between your code and the actual hardware.</p><p>A big plus of Stage3D is that you combine 3D hardware accelerated code with the great features and ease of use of regular 2D OpenFL authoring within the same application.</p><p>With Stage3D, regular OpenFL 2D content coexists with Stage3D content. So, you get all the power of OpenFL and you also get 3D accelerated content. You can choose to create a main 3D scene in the background or embed smaller 3D items that are part of the 2D experience.</p><p>Stage3D applications can run on a multitude of platforms. You can execute Stage3D applications as native Windows, macOS, and Linux applications, as well as running Stage3D in web browsers. It is even possible to use the same code to deploy the application to mobile platforms, such as iOS and Android. When you consider all of these options, it's easy to see how wide the distribution of a Stage3D application can potentially be.</p><h4 id="identifying-the-restrictions-of-stage3d" tabindex="-1">Identifying the restrictions of Stage3D</h4><p>The main drawbacks are based on the ability to develop one application for multiple platforms. By targeting all platforms at the same time with a single unified API, Stage3D cannot take advantage of the advanced features that are only present in the most powerful 3D graphics.</p><p>To ensure that one app fits all, Stage3D has to abstract a 3D hardware device that is a common denominator, in terms of graphics capabilities, among all the platforms that are targeted.</p><p>For example, modern GPU hardware supports the Shader Model (the standard used for Vertex and Fragment Shaders) version 4.0 or newer. However, Stage3D includes multiple <em>profiles</em>, which support increasing levels of capability. Depending on which profile is used, Stage3D may target an older Shader Model, as low as Shader Model version 2.0.</p><p>This means that when you are coding in Stage3D, and using a less capable profile, you may run across some limitations that you wouldn't encounter on higher end hardware. For example, the number of shader registers available using AGAL is quite limited. The <em>baseline</em> profiles and AGAL1 can use a maximum of 8 temporary registers. The <em>standard</em> profiles and AGAL2 can use a maximum of 26 temporary registers. These are lower than the 4096 available when coding registers in GLSL, with Shader Model 4.0.</p><p>Stage3D <em>baseline</em> profiles with AGAL1 shaders can only contain a maximum of 200 OpCodes, while <em>standard</em> profiles with AGAL2 shaders support 4096, similar to Shader Model 4.0. And Stage3D <em>baseline</em> profiles and AGAL1 shaders do not support conditional operations. However, Stage3D <em>standard</em> profiles and AGAL2 do, similar to Shader Model 3.0 and 4.0. No version of AGAL supports loops, but Shader Model 3.0 and 4.0 do.</p><p>In other words, shaders in Stage3D are designed to be very simple programs, as opposed to coding for more advanced hardware and Shader Models. As a result, some of the advanced effects using shaders that you see in today's AAA games might not be feasible with Stage3D.</p><h3 id="stage3d%3A-the-stage-behind-the-stage" tabindex="-1">Stage3D: The stage behind the Stage</h3><p>In this section you'll learn how Stage3D fits within the OpenFL display model.</p><p>OpenFL was designed based on the concept of the Stage. Every object displayed in OpenFL is a <code>DisplayObject</code> that is added to the Stage. So, Stage is the container of everything that is displayed. It is the root of all 2D items.</p><p>When Stage3D was introduced in OpenFL, it added a new set of special Stages that are specifically dedicated to 3D (see Figure 3).</p><p><img src="/openfl-adc-tutorials/articles/how-stage3d-works/fig03-v2.jpg" alt="Figure 3. Understanding how Stage3D is displayed as the stage behind the Stage."></p><p><em>Figure 3. Understanding how Stage3D is displayed as the stage behind the Stage.</em></p><p>There are a series of Stage3D Stages, and they are located behind the main OpenFL Stage. This means that the 3D content that you create with Stage3D is rendered in the rectangular viewport of each specific Stage3D, and then the regular 2D OpenFL content appears overlaid on top of it. You can see how you get the best of both worlds in this way: you get the rendering of your 3D scene, using hardware acceleration, and the 2D stuff (such as a game UI) on top.</p><p>You have more than one Stage3D available. Each Stage3D has its own rectangular viewport. This means that you can have a rectangular 3D area in one portion of your screen and add another one somewhere else, and lay the OpenFL 2D objects on top of both. The various Stage3D layers can partially (or even totally) overlap.</p><h3 id="accessing-stage3d-with-haxe" tabindex="-1">Accessing Stage3D with Haxe</h3><p>In order to access the Stage3D API using Haxe code, you'll declare one of the Stage3D stages. The stages are available as an array as part of the main OpenFL Stage.</p><p>You'll write code that looks something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-haxe">var stage3D:Stage3D = stage.stage3Ds[0];
</code></pre><p>The primary class of the Stage3D API is not Stage3D itself. It is a class called Context3D, which is more or less a rendering surface on steroids. It contains the surface on which you will render the 3D objects, and includes all the methods and properties needed to perform the rendering.</p><p>Context3D is the main entity you'll work with when using Stage3D.</p><p>The first thing you'll do with a Stage3D object is request a Context3D, like this:</p><pre><code class="language-haxe">stage.stage3Ds[0].addEventListener(Event.CONTEXT3D_CREATE, initStage3D);
stage.stage3Ds[0].requestContext3D();
</code></pre><p>Then, when the Context3D is created, the listener can access it, like this:</p><pre><code class="language-haxe">private function initStage3D(e:Event):Void
{
    context3D = stage.stage3Ds[0].context3D;
}
</code></pre><h3 id="defining-geometry-with-vertex-buffers-and-index-buffers" tabindex="-1">Defining geometry with Vertex Buffers and Index Buffers</h3><p>In Stage3D, the 3D scene that you render is comprised of a set of geometries (3D meshes). Each geometry is defined by a set of triangles. And each triangle is defined as a set of vertices.</p><p>All vertices that describe a geometry are packed together in a structure called a Vertex Buffer. This structure contains all of the data relative to the vertices. It is useful to keep this data all packed together because it can then be uploaded in one batch to the GPU memory.</p><p>Here is an example of the definition of a Vertex Buffer:</p><pre><code class="language-haxe">var vertices:Vector&lt;Float&gt; = Vector.ofValues(
    -0.3,-0.3, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, // x, y, z, r, g, b
    -0.3, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,
     0.3, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0,
     0.3,-0.3, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
</code></pre><p>First, define all of the vertices in a Vector. Each vertex not only contains the vertex positions, but may also contain additional data entries that specify properties of that vertex. These fields in each vertex structure are called Vertex Attributes.</p><p>Vertex Attributes can contain data related to the geometry that specifies how the geometry will be rendered by the rendering pipeline. For example, vertex colors or texture UV coordinates are usually specified for a geometry as Vertex Attributes.</p><p>In the example above, the <code>vertices</code> Vector defines four vertices. Each line is a vertex, and each vertex contains two Vertex Attributes: vertex position (the first three entries of each line) and vertex color (the second three entries of each line).</p><p>After creating this vector, you'll create a VertexBuffer3D instance. VertexBuffer3D is a class in the Stage3D API that wraps the Vertex Buffer data into the Stage3D API in order to upload the Vertex Buffer to GPU memory.</p><p>Here's the code you'll use to do that:</p><pre><code class="language-haxe">// 4 vertices, of 6 Floats each
vertexbuffer = context3D.createVertexBuffer(4, 6);
// offset 0, 4 vertices
vertexbuffer.uploadFromVector(vertices, 0, 4);
</code></pre><p>In Stage3D, specifying a Vertex Buffer is not enough to define a geometry. This is because 3D meshes in Stage3D are defined as indexed meshes.</p><p>In order to define a triangle, you must specify the three vertices of the triangle. So, to define geometry triangles, you'll need an additional structure that is used to index the vertices from the Vertex Buffer and assemble them into triangles. This structure is called an Index Buffer.</p><p>If you consider that the Vertex Buffer above defines four vertices, imagine the goal is to define a square, made of two triangles. The four vertices from the Vertex Buffer, by themselves, are not enough to define the two triangles to define a square.</p><p>Use the code below to create the additional Index Buffer:</p><pre><code class="language-haxe">var indices:Vector&lt;UInt&gt; = Vector.ofValues(0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0);
</code></pre><p>In this code example, the first three entries in the <code>indices</code> Vector, 0, 1, and 2, specify that the first triangle consists of vertices 0, 1, and 2 taken from the Vertex Buffer described above. Then, the Index Buffer generates a second triangle that consists of vertices 2, 3 and 0, again from the Vertex Buffer.</p><p>Using an Index Buffer, you effectively define the triangles, in order to create the geometry.</p><p>Like with the Vertex Buffer, the Index Buffer must be wrapped into its own Stage3D specific structure, called IndexBuffer3D. You'll use the IndexBuffer3D to upload your index buffer to the GPU, like this:</p><pre><code class="language-haxe">// total of 6 indices. 2 triangles by 3 vertices each
indexBuffer = context3D.createIndexBuffer(6);

// offset 0, count 6
indexBuffer.uploadFromVector(indices, 0, 6);
</code></pre><p>That's all that's required; the geometry is now defined.</p><h3 id="where-to-go-from-here" tabindex="-1">Where to go from here</h3><p>At this point you've completed the overview of working with Stage3D, the powerful API that enables hardware accelerated 3D rendering with OpenFL.
