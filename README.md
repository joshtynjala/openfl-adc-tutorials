# ADC Tutorials for OpenFL

A collection of tutorials and articles adapted for [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/)
from content originally published on the Adobe Developer Connection (ADC)
website for Flash and AIR.

Many of the ADC articles explicitly included the following notice:

> This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share
> Alike 3.0 Unported License

However, some of the articles included no such notice.

When ADC was shut down, Adobe created the
[Adobe Flash Runtimes: Documentation archives and downloads](https://web.archive.org/web/20240303072758/https://helpx.adobe.com/air/archived-docs-download.html)
page that continued to provide the articles in downloadable .zip archives.
Adobe's documentation archive page included the following notice:

> You can access the archived documents relevant to Flash Runtime even after the
> Flash EOL date. We are providing access to the archived documents for all the
> user/developers community to download. These documents are now no longer
> updated.

With this in mind, adapting any articles that were not explicitly Creative
Commons licensed should be considered fair use.
